# Processing-Final-Project-ENGG233
This was the final project that I created for my ENGG233 class, which took me a while.


this is a readme and likely the final contribution to the project.
fancy stuff.

Loads of comments, messy code (limited time and attention) makes a fun exploration
also look through the commit history, i put some detale into that.
